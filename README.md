# Complex Computation
This project involves classifying complex numbers based on their spiraling direction
(clockwise or counterclockwise) when iteratively squared, cubed, etc.

`### How to setup project:-
1. To get started with the project, first clone the repository
2. Next, install the necessary packages by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
3. Set the desired lower and upper limits for the dataset in 'acDataset_generator.py',
   and run the script to generate the dataset.
4. Load the generated dataset into 'ab_preprocess_org.ipynb' for preprocessing and cleaning, 
   then into 'ab_preprocess_org.ipynb' for further cleaning.
5. Finally, analyze the cleaned and labeled dataset in 'complexnum.ipynb' for 
   insights on classification and visualizations.


### Some Conclusions:
1. The most effective classification model was found to be K-nearest neighbor.
2.
